        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>  
            Biryani is a beloved and iconic dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent, 
            but it has since spread its culinary influence across the globe.It's a flavorful one-pot dish made with 
            aromatic basmati rice, fragrant spices, and a choice of meat, poultry, fish, or vegetables. The ingredients are typically cooked together in layers,
            allowing the flavors to meld and create a rich and complex taste.

            The key to a good biryani lies in the careful balance of spices, which may include cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, bay leaves, and cumin, among others. 
            Saffron-infused milk is often used to give the dish its signature golden color and distinct aroma. Additionally, fried onions, mint, and cilantro are 
            commonly used as garnishes to enhance the dish's flavor and presentation.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Basmati Rice: Long-grain aromatic rice is traditionally used for biryani.</li>
            <li>Meat: Chicken, mutton (goat), beef, or even fish or shrimp can be used. It's typically cut into pieces.</li>
            <li>Yogurt: Plain yogurt is often used to marinate the meat, tenderizing it and adding flavor.</li>
            <li>Onions: Sliced onions are usually fried until golden brown and added in layers.</li>
            <li>Tomatoes: Some recipes include tomatoes, either diced or made into a paste.</li>
            <li>Ginger-Garlic Paste: A combination of fresh ginger and garlic crushed or blended into a paste.</li>
            <li>Green Chilies: Optional, for adding heat to the dish.</li>
            <li>Biryani Masala: A blend of spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, bay leaves, cumin, coriander, and others.</li>
            <li>Saffron: A few strands of saffron soaked in warm milk to add color and flavor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Meat: Marinate your choice of meat (chicken, mutton, or beef) with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala, salt, and optionally some chopped mint leaves and green chilies. Allow it to marinate for at least 30 minutes to overnight in the refrigerator for maximum flavor.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Rice: Rinse basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Then, soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt and whole spices like bay leaves, cardamom, and cloves. Parboil the rice until it is about 70-80% cooked. Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Fry Onions: In a separate pan, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Fry thinly sliced onions until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove the fried onions from the pan and set them aside.</li>
            <li>Layering: In a heavy-bottomed pot or deep casserole dish, start by layering the marinated meat at the bottom. Spread it out evenly. Then, layer half of the partially cooked rice over the meat. Sprinkle some fried onions, chopped mint leaves, and optionally some saffron-infused milk over the rice. Repeat with another layer of meat and the remaining rice.</li>
            <li>Dum Cooking (Steam Cooking): Cover the pot tightly with a lid or seal it with dough to prevent steam from escaping. Cook the biryani on low heat for about 20-30 minutes. You can also place the pot on a tava (griddle) or a heat diffuser to ensure even cooking and prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Resting Period: Once the biryani is cooked, turn off the heat and let it rest for another 10-15 minutes without opening the lid. This allows the flavors to meld together and the rice to absorb any remaining moisture.</li>
            <li>Serve: Gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers before serving. Garnish with additional fried onions, chopped cilantro, and mint leaves if desired. Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) or your favorite side dishes.</li>
        </ol>
